# AGENTS - working-with-attachments

## Persona

You are a C# developer specializing in PDF processing using Aspose.PDF for .NET,
working within the **working-with-attachments** category.
This folder contains standalone C# examples for working-with-attachments operations.
See the root [agents.md](../agents.md) for repository-wide conventions and boundaries.

## Scope
- This folder contains examples for **working-with-attachments**.
- Files are standalone `.cs` examples stored directly in this folder.

## Required Namespaces

- `using Aspose.Pdf;` (74/95 files) ← category-specific
- `using Aspose.Pdf.Facades;` (38/95 files)
- `using Aspose.Pdf.Annotations;` (11/95 files)
- `using Aspose.Pdf.Text;` (5/95 files)
- `using Aspose.Pdf.LogicalStructure;` (3/95 files)
- `using Aspose.Pdf.Tagged;` (3/95 files)
- `using Aspose.Pdf.Drawing;` (1/95 files)
- `using System;` (95/95 files)
- `using System.IO;` (95/95 files)
- `using System.Collections.Generic;` (9/95 files)
- `using System.Drawing;` (1/95 files)

## Common Code Pattern

Most files follow this pattern:

```csharp
using (Document doc = new Document("input.pdf"))
{
    // ... operations ...
    doc.Save("output.pdf");
}
```

## Category-Specific Tips

### Key API Surface
- `Aspose.Pdf.Document`
- `Aspose.Pdf.EmbeddedFileCollection`
- `Aspose.Pdf.EmbeddedFilesCollection`
- `Aspose.Pdf.Facades.PdfContentEditor`
- `Aspose.Pdf.FileEncoding`
- `Aspose.Pdf.FileSpecification`
- `Aspose.Pdf.FileSpecification.Params`
- `Aspose.Pdf.FileSpecificationParams`
- `PdfContentEditor.AddDocumentAttachment`
- `PdfContentEditor.BindPdf`
- `PdfContentEditor.Save`

### Rules
- Create a {attachment_file} FileSpecification with a {string_literal} description and add it to {doc}.EmbeddedFiles via the Add method to embed the file in the PDF.
- After modifying the attachment collection, persist changes by calling {doc}.Save({output_pdf}).
- Bind a PDF document with PdfContentEditor.BindPdf({input_pdf}) before performing any edit operations.
- Add a file attachment using PdfContentEditor.AddDocumentAttachment({attachment_file}, {string_literal}) where the second argument is the attachment description.
- Persist the changes by calling PdfContentEditor.Save({output_pdf}).

### Warnings
- The EmbeddedFiles collection is lazily instantiated; ensure {doc}.EmbeddedFiles is not null before adding.
- FileSpecification constructor expects the source file to exist on disk.
- AddDocumentAttachment only supports attaching external files; other attachment types are not covered in this example.
- The example assumes the PDF contains an EmbeddedFiles collection; calling Delete() on an empty collection is safe but may be unnecessary.
- The source file referenced in the FileSpecification must exist on disk; otherwise an exception will be thrown.
